The all pair shortest path algorithm is also known as Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to find all pair shortest path problem from a given weighted graph. As a result of this algorithm, it will generate a matrix, which will represent the minimum distance from any node to all other nodes in the graph.
in other words The problem is to find the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge-weighted directed Graph.

in solution; I use i and j to show two node position and k to show the node position that via that position we go from node i to j
