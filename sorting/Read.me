Sorting Algorithm implemtation 

Among these Sorting Algorithms that I have written, 
Merge Sort and Quick Sort is the best. beacuse of
the use of Devide and Conquer.

So Time Comlexity in Merge and Quick are: O(n log n)
and Space Comlexity are O(n) for Merge and O(log n) for Quick

Quick Sort in worse case is O(n^2)

in Bubble, Inserrion and Selection Sort
Time Comlexity are O(n^2)
Space Comlexity are O(1)
